                audioo [<span style="font-weight: bold">aw</span>-dee-oh] is a
                platform that allows the user to mix and play background sounds
                to promote focusing, studying, and relaxation. We hope you find audioo useful and enjoy the variety of sounds available.

                Small redesign of home page to provide a few default sounds to play as a "sample" of the website's use function. A playlists section has been added with three playlists to choose from currently. Each one has 6 sounds to listen to. Over time, this section of site will expand.<br /><br />-greg

            <p class="faq-question">What did you use to make audioo?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Audioo was created from scratch with plain-old html, css, and
                javascript. I used
                <span class="link"

                for the audio engine and

                for the icons.

            <p class="faq-question">Can I contribute audio of my own?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">

                + The audio must be at least CD quality (16 bit, 44.1kHz).<br>
                + No longer than one minute, but preferably shorter in duration.<br>

            <p class="faq-question">The sound doesn't work on my phone!</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Outside of making sure the volume is up, having the phone on
                silent mode can mute the sound on the website.
