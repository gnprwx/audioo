            <p>
                audioo [<span style="font-weight: bold">aw</span>-dee-oh] is my
                first project as a novice web developer. The idea is to
                incorporate my musical background and provide personally-made
                loopable ambient music whilst also providing nature sounds and
                white noise like other similar platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, audioo is in its alpha stage and only offers one page
                of sound selections. But that will change soon. As I add more
                sound categories, I will be working to improve the user
                experience and efficiency of the site itself. Thank you for
                listening!

            <p class="faq-answer">
                Currently, we have one page of soothing background sounds.
                However, in the near future, audioo will expand on sounds and
                music to further promote focusing, studying, and relaxation.
                Check back once in a while to experience what else we've added!

                What type of license do these sounds have?
            </p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                All sounds on this website are under the

                license, which means they reside in the public domain.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-question">What do you use to make audioo?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Audioo is created from scratch with plain-old html, css,
                javascript. I use
                <span class="link"
                    ><a href="https://howlerjs.com/" target="_blank"
                        >howler.js</a
                    ></span
                >
                for the audio engine and
                <span class="link"
                    ><a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" target="_blank"
                        >flaticon</a
                    ></span
                >
                for the icons.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-question">Can I contribute audio of my own?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Sure! Although, I'll have to screen it to meet what I think
                would fit with the website itself first. If you do have audio
                you want to contribute, please follow the guidelines below. If
                your audio meets the requirements, you can submit your audio on
                our discord, which is linked below.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-question">What are the submission guidelines?</p>
            <ul class="req">
                <li>Audio must be in .wav, .aiff, or .flac format.</li>
                <li>
                    The audio must be at least CD quality (16 bit, 44.1kHz).
                </li>
                <li>
                    No longer than one minute, but preferably shorter in
                    duration.
                </li>
                <li>Hosted somewhere so I can retrieve it.</li>
                <li>
                    You must agree to use
                    <span class="link"

                            href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/"

                            >CC0</a
                        ></span
                    >
                    for its license.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="faq-question">The sound doesn't work on my phone!</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Outside of making sure the volume is up, having the phone on
                silent mode can mute the sound on the website.
            </p>
