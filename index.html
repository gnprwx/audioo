                audioo [<span style="font-weight: bold">aw</span>-dee-oh] is a
                platform that allows the user to mix and play background sounds
                to promote focusing, studying, and relaxation. More sounds and a better user experience are planned for the near future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, audioo is in its alpha stage and only offers one page
                of sound selections, but that will change soon with my own
                content and user-submitted content. In the meantime, enjoy, and
                thank you for listening!<br /><br />-greg

            <p class="faq-answer">
                Audioo was created from scratch with plain-old html, css, and
                javascript. I used

            <p class="faq-question">The sound doesn't work on my phone!</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Outside of making sure the volume is up, having the phone on
                silent mode can mute the sound on the website.
