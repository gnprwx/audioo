        <p class="faq-question">What does audi∞ provide that other similar platforms don't?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">While providing the same service as background sound websites, I will be adding my own music and sounds, so you can focus, relax, or fill the silence however you see fit in a fairly unique way.</p>
        <p class="faq-question">What type of license do these sounds have?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">All sounds on this website are under the <span class="link"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/" target="_blank">CC0</a></span> license, which means they reside in the public domain.</p>
        <p class="faq-question">What do you use to make audi∞?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">audi∞ is created from scratch with plain-old html, css, javascript, and <span class="link"><a href="https://howlerjs.com/" target="_blank">howler.js</a></span>. I will be doing my best to optimize this site and add features as I continue learning front-end development.</p>
        <p class="faq-question">Can I contribute audio of my own?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">Sure! Although, I'll have to screen it to meet what I think would fit with the website itself first. If you do have audio you want to contribute, please follow the guidelines below. If your audio meets the requirements, you can submit your audio to greg@audioo.org</p>
        <p class="faq-question">What are the submission guidelines?</p>
        <ul class="req">
            <li>Audio must be in .wav, .aiff, or .flac format.</li>
            <li>The audio must be at least CD quality (16 bit, 44.1kHz).</li>
            <li>No longer than two minutes, but preferably a shorter duration.</li>
            <li>Hosted somewhere so I can retrieve it.</li>
            <li>You must agree to use <span class="link"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/" target="_blank">CC0</a></span> for its license.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="faq-question">The sound doesn't work on my phone!</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">Outside of making sure the volume is up, having the phone on silent mode can mute the sound on the website.</p>
        <p class="faq-question">I found a bug! Where can I report it?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">You can report it through my email at greg@audioo.org.</p>
