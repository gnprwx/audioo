        <p class="about">audiâˆž [<span style="font-weight: bold;">aw</span>-dee-oh] was created by musician and budding web developer Gregory Pappas. In his first foray into web development, he sought to bring what he loves and what he's learning: music and web technology. Inspired by other websites and apps in the same vein, he envisioned creating an immersive audio experience that went beyond providing background nature sounds and white noise.</p>
        <p class="about">While also providing the same service, the idea originally came through wanting to take the idea of loopable background sounds and applying it with his original music. This provides a light version of letting the user "mix" in the same way as the other sound profiles (categories) available on the site.</p>
        <p class="about">In the alpha stage, however, the goal of the site to provide original music for the user will not be ready yet. Greg is still hard at work learning front-end development to make this site work as well as possible in terms of functional user interface and user experience. Adding sounds readily available to put in different sound profiles is a bit faster in the meantime. When these profiles function as intended, then Greg will integrate his music into the music profiles for users to interact with. That's where the beta will begin.</p>
        <p class="about">This website is created from scratch with plain-old html, css, and javascript. It utilizes <a href="https://howlerjs.com/" target="_blank">howler.js</a> as the audio engine.</p>
